Yes beginning to learn a lot.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would be easier to go back to any previous versions if something stopped working abruptly or if any old feature is required to be enabled back.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

manually gives better control

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
use git log to view the history of commits and use git diff to view differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because I know I could always fix it easily by reverting to previous version and identify the line which introduced the bug using the git diff.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
To try version control
