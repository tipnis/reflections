How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is different as it can be used to place files to be commited. Also my earlier lesson 2 reflections file got erased by mistake.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

add files to staging area upon each logical change and commit them before adding more.
